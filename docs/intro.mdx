## 📘 Introduction

**Stackflow – Compliance Automated** is a developer-first compliance management platform designed to streamline policy documentation, risk tracking, and audit readiness. It provides a centralized system that automates the mapping and monitoring of security controls across widely adopted frameworks such as:

- ✅ ISO/IEC 27001  
- ✅ SOC 2 (Type I & II)  
- ✅ GDPR  
- ✅ HIPAA  
- ✅ NIST CSF

Built with a modern React frontend and a flexible backend architecture, Stackflow allows engineering and compliance teams to:

- ⚙️ **Automate evidence collection** from internal systems and cloud tools  
- 📄 **Maintain real-time documentation** for audits and internal reviews  
- 🔄 **Reuse controls and policies** across multiple frameworks  
- 📊 **Track audit readiness** with dashboards and metrics
